                    <p class="indented">One of the few of Albay’s heritage churches that withstood the effects of Mayon volcano’s 
                        eruptions is the Daraga Church or also known as Nuestra Señora de la Porteria Parish Church. 
                        Perched on a hill with a commanding view of the majestic Mayon Volcano, Daraga Church  stands 
                        as a lasting testament of faith, artistry, and resilience of Albayanos.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">Built by Franciscan missionaries in 1773 atop a hill, the church offers an unimpeded view of the 
                        majestic Mayon Volcano and is renowned for its rich Baroque architecture. Its massive volcanic 
                        rock structure features a cruciform layout, an octagonal bell tower, and intricately carved Salomónica 
                        columns adorned with vine motifs and ecclesiastical emblems. In 2007, the National Historical Institute 
                        declared this site a National Cultural Treasure.  A 2012 restoration by the NCCA helped preserve these details 
                        using traditional lime wash and native stone, ensuring that Daraga Church remains not only a sanctuary of worship 
                        but also a cultural landmark and symbol of enduring heritage.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>
                    <p class="indented">Daraga was founded by residents from Cagsawa who sought refuge from the threat of future eruptions by the Mayon 
                        Volcano. Concerned for their safety, they petitioned the Spanish colonial authorities to establish a new settlement 
                        and church south of Cagsawa. Their request was approved on June 12, 1772, through a directive from Governor-General 
                        Simon de Salazar to the Alcade-mayor of Camarines.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">Construction of the current Daraga Church began in 1773 under the guidance of Franciscan missionaries, 
                        at a time when Daraga was still a visita or mission station of Cagsawa. The church was strategically 
                        built atop a hill in Barangay Santa Maria, offering a commanding view of Mayon Volcano. When Mayon erupted 
                        on February 1, 1814, devastating the town and church of Cagsawa, many survivors relocated to Daraga, further 
                        cementing the latter’s role as a new religious and community center. Although many believe Daraga Church was 
                        built after the eruption as a replacement for Cagsawa Church, historical records confirm it predates the event. 
                        The church was formally consecrated to Nuestra Señora de la Porteria (Our Lady of the Gate) in 1854.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">During World War II in 1945, Daraga Church suffered significant damage from aerial bombings by joint American and 
                        Filipino forces. The post-war renovation incorporated elements of Renaissance Gothic and Mexican Baroque styles. 
                        Between 1971 and 1973, further changes were made to align the church’s design with the liturgical reforms of the 
                        Second Vatican Council. In 1991, the altar was returned to its original location to restore historical integrity.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">To preserve its architectural and cultural legacy, restoration efforts have continued through the years. In recognition 
                        of its significance, the National Museum of the Philippines declared parts of the church, including the eastern and western 
                        façades, bell tower, and baptistry, as a National Cultural Treasure in 2007. A year later, on October 16, 2008, the National 
                        Historical Institute unveiled its official historical marker.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Facts</h2>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="../static/images/daraga-church-1950.webp" alt="Daraga Church">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Daraga Church in 1950</span>
                    <p class="indented">Daraga Church is an exquisite example of Churrigueresque architecture, a highly decorative Spanish Baroque style, best seen 
                        in its ornate façade. Built using locally sourced volcanic rock, the structure blends natural materials with intricate artistry, 
                        symbolizing the resilience and faith of the Albayanos who constructed it. The church’s current white exterior is a result of a 
                        protective lime coating, applied during conservation efforts to guard the centuries-old stonework against weathering and erosion.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">One of the church’s most striking features is its four Solomonic (salomónicas) columns, rare in Philippine ecclesiastical architecture. 
                        These spiral columns adorn the main façade and each holds a medallion carved with one of the four Evangelists, merging biblical iconography 
                        with dramatic design. Unlike most Baroque churches, Daraga’s façade lacks traditional vertical pilasters or horizontal cornices, giving it 
                        a flowing and unconfined character that feels both ancient and uniquely Filipino.
                    </p>
                    <p>Adding further depth to its symbolism are engraved religious elements, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Statues of Franciscan saints, reflecting the order that built and served the church.</li>
                        <li>Rare ecclesiastical seals, such as:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The coat of arms of the Franciscan Order.</li>
                                <li>The Papal tiara with crossed keys, symbolizing divine authority.</li>
                                <li>The five wounds (stigmata) of St. Francis, a mark of humility and sacrifice.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A Latin inscription above the main arch reads:
                            <ul>
                                <p style="margin: 0;">"Bene fundata est domus Domini supra firmam petram"</p>
                                <p style="margin: 0;">(“Well founded is the house of the Lord on firm rock”), echoing both scripture and the church’s solid foundation on volcanic stone.</p>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Belfry: Echoes of the Apostles</h2>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="../static/images/daraga-church-belfry.jpg" alt="Daraga Church Belfry">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Daraga Church Belfry</span>
                    <p class="indented">To the left of the church stands its octagonal bell tower, rising in four graceful tiers and culminating in a dome and cross. The base of the belfry 
                        features reliefs of the Twelve Apostles, carved into six of its sides, an artistic representation of the Church’s foundation in apostolic tradition. Each level of the 
                        tower narrows upward, symbolizing the church’s spiritual ascent toward heaven, with the sound of its bell once guiding the faithful to prayer and safety.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Trivia</h2>
                    <p class="indented">The church’s dedication to Nuestra Señora de la Porteria traces back to Fray Luis de San Jose, a humble Franciscan lay brother who 
                        lived in 18th-century Ávila, Spain. Serving as a gardener and porter in a Franciscan convent, Fray Luis reportedly experienced a miraculous encounter 
                        with the Blessed Virgin Mary during a devastating flood that spared his life. In thanksgiving, he commissioned an image of the Virgin and placed it at the 
                        convent’s entrance, the porteria, where he and others regularly offered their prayers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">This image became a focal point of devotion, especially among the townsfolk who frequented the convent. Over time, reverence for Our Lady of the Gate grew and 
                        eventually reached the Philippines through Franciscan missionaries. In 1854, the Daraga Church was formally consecrated in her honor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented"> Local traditions continue to uphold the Virgin’s significance. During World War II, some residents claimed to see a mysterious light hovering above the church during 
                        the bombings, believed by many to be a sign of the Virgin’s protection. Devotees also recount answered prayers for healing, with some offering barefoot pilgrimages up 
                        the hill in gratitude to the patroness of Daraga.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Daraga Church vs. Cagsawa Ruins: Twin Survivors</h2>
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="../static/images/daraga-vs-cagasawa-church.jpg" alt="Daraga Church and Cagsawa Church">
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Daraga Church and Cagsawa Church</span>
                    <p class="indented">Often compared and forever linked by history, Daraga Church and the Cagsawa Ruins stand as powerful symbols of resilience in Albay. While Cagsawa Church was famously 
                        destroyed by the devastating eruption of Mayon Volcano in 1814, its surviving belfry has become a haunting reminder of nature’s power. In contrast, Daraga Church, 
                        perched strategically on a hill in nearby Barangay Santa Maria, was spared from the lava flows, becoming a refuge for Cagsawa’s displaced parishioners.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">This connection forged the twin legacy of the two landmarks: Cagsawa as a symbol of loss and remembrance, and Daraga as a sanctuary and continuation of faith. 
                        Together, they tell the story of Albayanos’ strength and their unshakable devotion amidst adversity.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Annual Festivals & Processions</h2>

                                        Albay in the Bicol Region
                                        of the Philippines, is renowned for its near-perfect symmetrical
                                        cone shape.
                                        Standing at 2,463 meters (8,081 feet), it is one of the most active
                                        volcanoes in the country and a prominent symbol of natural beauty
                                        and danger.
                                        Its frequent eruptions have shaped both the landscape and the lives
                                        of the people living around it,
                                        making it a vital part of Bicolano culture and identity.</p>

                                        came from a place called Budiao. Under the leadership
                                        of Juan Salcedo, the Spaniards arrived and established this village.
                                        The name "Budiao" is
                                        derived from the word "badjao," which means "the greatest," as
                                        demonstrated by the "ilustrados"
                                        (educated elite) among the spectators of bullfights. In Budiao,
                                        there was a designated area for
                                        the battle between men and bulls, following a tradition reminiscent
                                        of ancient Rome.</p>

                                        Dutch pirates in 1636. It was rebuilt in 1724 by Fr. Francisco
                                        Blanco but was destroyed again, along with the town of Cagsawa, on
