                    <h2 class="section-heading">History</h2>
                    <p class="indented">
                        The first settlers of the town of Daraga came from a place called Budiao. Under the leadership
                        of Juan Salcedo, the Spaniards arrived and established this village. The name "Budiao" is
                        derived from the word "badjao," which means "the greatest," as demonstrated by the "ilustrados"
                        (educated elite) among the spectators of bullfights. In Budiao, there was a designated area for
                        the battle between men and bulls, following a tradition reminiscent of ancient Rome.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">For the Spaniards, watching and observing bullfights brought a unique kind of pleasure. However,
                        in 1578, the town was re-established in Cagsawa. This relocation was due to the people's fear of
                        another eruption from Mayon Volcano, which could destroy their properties and livelihoods. On
                        June 12, 1772, the town was moved once again—this time farther away from the volcano. It was
                        relocated to the top of a hill where the famous Daraga Church now stands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">On February 1, 1814, after more than 40 years of peaceful living in their new settlement, an
                        unexpected tragedy struck. Mayon Volcano erupted, covering the entire town in ash. The volcano's
                        unrest did not cease, so in 1993, the residents were permanently relocated to their new home in
                        the southern barangay of Anislag.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Bull Fighting</h2>
                    <p class="indented">Barangay Budiao is known for its "bullfighting," where "bullfighters" and bulls face off in a
                        designated "bull arena" located in Barangay Budiao, Daraga, Albay.</p>
                    <p class="indented">Bullfighting is said to be one of Spain's influences on the Philippines, considered both a
                        ceremony and a festival. Beyond that, it is a cultural symbol for the residents of Barangay
                        Budiao, as it was once a common tradition. Because of this, it is regarded as part of the
                        barangay's history.</p>
                    <p class="indented">Many claim that bullfighting and cockfighting are similar, but the two have significant
                        differences. Cockfighting, or sabong, is a match between two roosters, while bullfighting is a
                        contest where a bull is pitted against a "bullfighter" (a player usually riding a horse), also
                        called a torero. There are three types of toreros: the matador de toros (the main fighter), the
                        picador (two supporters of the matador positioned behind the horse), and the banderillero (three
                        supporters of the matador stationed at the horse's feet).</p>
                    <p class="indented">The toreros begin their attack once the bull enters the arena. The fight is divided into four
                        parts. First, the matador de toros observes the bull's movements, and the picador initiates the
                        first strike. Second, the banderilleros stab colorful sticks with spikes into the bull's muscles
                        to weaken its movements and prevent attacks. Next comes the "death" phase, executed by the
                        matador de toros, who attacks the bull's aorta (main blood vessel) with a sword, potentially
                        leading to the bull's death. Finally, the fight is judged. The Presidente (head judge) and the
                        spectators determine the outcome.</p>
                    <p class="indented">Another difference between cockfighting and bullfighting is the prize. In cockfighting, winners
                        receive money, while in bullfighting, the matador may be awarded the bull's ear and tail,
                        depending on the judgment of the Presidente and the audience. Beyond physical rewards, one of
                        the most coveted honors is recognition as a skilled bullfighter.</p>
                    <p class="indented">Because of this, bullfighting is seen as an activity contrary to the teachings of the Church, as
                        it is considered a form of gambling. It is also said to violate Christian principles, which
                        emphasize valuing animals as part of human responsibility. Additionally, it is viewed as a
                        practice that leads to the "senseless" death of bulls. Despite all this, bullfighting remained a
                        popular form of entertainment in the past. It was once recognized as a daily tradition and is
                        now acknowledged as part of history.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Devil in "Apay"</h2>
                    <p class="indented">This is a barber’s tale that became famous in their barangay. According to them, it is about a
                        married couple—a man and a woman—who once lived in Budiao. Their relationship turned sour due to
                        the husband’s infidelity.</p>
                    <p class="indented">One day, the wife was searching for her husband, but the man hid among the leaves of a taro
                        plant, locally called apay. However, his wife spotted him and began cursing and shouting,
                        "Jusmiyong apay na an!" ("Good grief, it's the apay devil!"). From that moment on, the legend of
                        The Devil in the Apay began.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Budiao Ruins: The Distinctive</h2>
<a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/c-ruins.PNG" alt="..."></a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Mayon Volcano along with the Daraga Church</span>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">The Budiao Ruins are recognized as a damaged church located in
                        Barangay Budiao, Daraga, Albay. It is dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady, symbolizing
                        Budiao's history as a town.</blockquote>
                    <p class="indented">Budiao began as a visita (mission chapel) under the parish of St. James the Great in Cagsawa,
                        then part of the province of Camarines. In 1772, the people of Cagsawa petitioned the Superior
                        Government in Manila to relocate the visita to Daraga due to fears of potential destruction from
                        Mayon Volcano's eruptions. The request was approved, but the transfer did not proceed because
                        Fermin Zaldivar, the new Alcalde Mayor of Camarines, opposed it. Instead, he advocated for
                        moving to Budiao, leading to its establishment as a town on November 29, 1786, through a decree
                        by the Superior Government.</p>
                    <p class="indented">At the same time, Fr. Juan Duares resisted the transfer and the leadership of the new parish.
                        Fortunately, in 1798, Fr. Francisco Aragoes took over the administration of the Budiao and
                        Cagsawa parish. The church was constructed using volcanic stones, with crushed shells and corals
                        serving as mortar. However, it was destroyed by the eruption of Mayon Volcano on February 1,
                        1814, when pyroclastic flows devastated the church building, killing 200 people inside. This was
                        followed by lahars and other volcanic debris that buried the structure up to the top of its
                        walls.</p>
                    <p class="indented">In 2018, archaeological excavations revealed that the Budiao Church might have been larger than
                        Cagsawa Church, possibly reaching a height of 10 meters. That same year, the first holy mass was
                        held within the ruins after more than 200 years since its destruction.</p>
                    <p class="indented">In 2017, the Municipal Government of Daraga declared the Budiao Ruins as a local heritage site.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented">Today, the Budiao Ruins are officially recognized as the 5th National Cultural Treasure in the
                        province of Albay.</p>

                                        structures, and landscapes that echo centuries of Filipino
                                        history—but also brimming with modern attractions that reflect its

                                        historically spelled as Cagsaua) are the remnants of a 16th-century
                                        Franciscan church, the Cagsawa church. It was originally built in
                                        the town of Cagsawa in 1587 but was burned down and destroyed by
                                        Dutch pirates in 1636. It was rebuilt in 1724 by Fr. Francisco
                                        Blanco but was destroyed again, along with the town of Cagsawa, on
                                        February 1, 1814, during the eruption of Mayon Volcano.</p>
