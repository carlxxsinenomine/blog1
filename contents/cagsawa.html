                    <p class="indented">The Cagsawa Ruins (also spelled as Kagsawa, historically spelled as Cagsaua) are the remnants of a 16th-century Franciscan church, the Cagsawa church. It was originally built in the town of Cagsawa in 1587 but was burned down and destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1636. It was rebuilt in 1724 by Fr. Francisco Blanco but was destroyed again, along with the town of Cagsawa, on February 1, 1814, during the eruption of Mayon Volcano.</p>
                    <p class="indented">The ruins are currently located in Barangay Busay, Cagsawa, in the municipality of Daraga, Albay, Philippines. It is part of Cagsawa Park, is protected and maintained by the municipal government of Daraga and the National Museum of the Philippines, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the area. The Internationale Tourismus-Börse Berlin, one of the world's top travel trade shows based in Berlin, has even recognized the site as one of the places to visit in Asia. A preliminary excavation of the Cagsawa ruins by the Bulacan State University, show that the Spanish incorporated Mesoamerican influences in constructing the complex.</p>
                    <p class="indented">The Cagsawa ruins are located 2.2 km (1.4 mi) from the town of Daraga and are approximately 8 km (5.0 mi) from the city of Legazpi. They are also 3.3 km (2.1 mi) from the Legazpi Airport and a 55-minute flight from Manila.  By bus, the location is 12 to 14 hours away from Manila.</p>

                        It is considered symbolic of the dangers of living in close proximity with Mt. Mayon, as it is situated roughly 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) away from the volcano.
                    </blockquote>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Historical Background</h2>
                    <p class="indented">Cagsawa Ruins are a remnant of what was once historically a Franciscan-built church complex. The first friars of the Alcantarine group of the Order of Friars Minor arrived and started their mission in the settlement in 1587. The church was erected by Fr. Pedro Bautista in 1591. However, it was not spared when Cagsawa was razed by the invading Dutch armed forces wanting to seize control of the colony from the Spaniards on July 25, 1639.</p>
                    <p class="indented">The first church made of stone was erected by Fr. Acacio de la Conception in 1675 and dedicated to the advocation of St. James the Greater. In 1724, it was leveled to the ground by Fr. Francisco Blanco to give way to a new, bigger church. He also built other edifices such as the convent, court house, store rooms, and the now famous belfry.</p>
                    <p class="indented">On the fateful day of February 1, 1814, Mayon Volcano erupted. According to records, the bells of the parish tolled to warn the townsfolk of the calamity. Two hundred people took shelter within the walls of the church, but they soon were trapped and died from the pyroclastic flow and lahar. The devastation buried Budiao, Camalig, Cagsawa, and Guinobatan in a layer of volcanic materials, rocks, and ash. It is estimated 1,200 people perished on that cataclysmic day.</p>
                    <p class="indented">What remained of the 18th-century, Baroque stone church were a part of the facade including an intact pediment and the adjoining bell tower. The facade however fell to rubble sometime in the 1930s, while the uppermost portion of the iconic pyramidal bell tower remains standing.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Facts and Trivias</h2>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">The original name was “Cagsaua”</blockquote>
                    <p class="indented">Cagsawa was derived from the word “Kag” which means owner and “sawa” for python. It could also mean too much or excesses. The Cagsawa church was built after 1724 by the Franciscan friars and was administered by Fray Francisco Blanco in the small town of Cagsawa.</p>
                    <p class="indented">The bell tower is all that visibly remains of the church.
                        One of the most photographed landmarks in the Philippines.
                        Declared a National Cultural Treasure.
                        There are occasional claims of ghost stories or buried 
                        structures beneath.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Cultural and Social Relevance</h2>
                    <p class="indented">The ruins are what remains of the Cagsawa Church, buried by the catastrophic eruption of Mayon Volcano in 1814. Thousands perished, and entire towns were destroyed, yet the surviving bell tower stands tall—a silent witness to the disaster and a testament to human resilience. Today, it serves as a reminder of both tragedy and the ability to rebuild.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tourism and Festivals</h2>
                    <p class="indented">Cagsawa Festival is an annual celebration of Cagsawa Ruins, a National Cultural Treasure located in the village of Busay in the municipality of Daraga, Albay, Philippines every February.</p>
                    <p class="indented">It is a fest that puts into center stage the beautiful landscape and history of Cagsawa, its popular ruins often photographed with Mt. Mayon in the background.

                                    <p class="blog-description">The first settlers of the town of Daraga
                                        came from a place called Budiao. Under the leadership
                                        of Juan Salcedo, the Spaniards arrived and established this village.
                                        The name "Budiao" is
                                        derived from the word "badjao," which means "the greatest," as
                                        demonstrated by the "ilustrados"
                                        (educated elite) among the spectators of bullfights. In Budiao,
                                        there was a designated area for
                                        the battle between men and bulls, following a tradition reminiscent
                                        of ancient Rome.</p>
